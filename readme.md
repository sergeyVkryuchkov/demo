# Games

The purpose of this repository is to make demo versions of games available to everybody.

The naming convention of the subdirectories of the repository is simple:

Each game demo will have two directories named
- <__game-name__> containing the 64-bits version of the game
- <__game-name>32__ containing the 32-bits version of the game

Right now the only game available is __qoo__. I hope there will be more going forward.
So, right now you should see two (sub)directories: __qoo__ and __qoo32__.

Each of the game subdirectory contains the __readme.md__ file describing the game and how the 
game can be controlled.
